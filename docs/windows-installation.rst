Installing Futhark on Windows
=============================

This guide describes problems that might arise when installing the
Futhark compiler on Windows.  While the Futhark compiler itself is
easily installed, it takes a little more work to make the OpenCL and
PyOpenCL backends functional.  This guide was last updated on the 5th
of May 2016, and is for computers using 64-bit Windows along with
`CUDA 7.5`_ and Python 2.7 (`Anaconda`_ preferred).

Also `Git for Windows`_ is required for its Linux command line tools. 
If you have not marked the option to add them to path, there are 
instructions below how to do so. The GUI alternative to ``git``, `Github Desktop`_ 
is optional and does not come with the required tools.

Setting up Futhark and OpenCL
-----------------------------

1) Fork and clone the Futhark repository to your hard drive.

2) Install `Stack`_ using the 64-bit installer.  Compile the Futhark
   compiler as described in :ref:`installation`.

3) For editing environment variables it is strongly recommended that
   you install the `Rapid Environment Editor`_

4) For a Futhark compatible C/C++ compiler, that you will also need to
   install pyOpenCL later, install MingWpy. Do this using the ``pip
   install - i https ://pypi.anaconda.org/carlkl/simple mingwpy``
   command.

5) Assuming you have the latest Anaconda distribution as your primary
   one, it will get installed to a place such as
   ``C:\Users\UserName\Anaconda2\share\mingwpy``. The pip installation
   will not add its bin or include directories to path.

   To do so, open the Rapid Environment Editor and add
   ``C:\Users\UserName\Anaconda2\share\mingwpy\bin`` to the system-wide
   ``PATH`` variable.

   If you have other MingW or GCC distributions, make sure MingWpy takes
   priority by moving its entry above the other distributions. You can
   also change which Python distribution is the default one using the
   same trick should you need so.

   If have done so correctly, typing ``where gcc`` in the command prompt
   should list the aforementioned MingWpy installation at the top or show
   only it.

   To finish the installation, add the
   ``C:\UserName\Marko\Anaconda2\share\mingwpy\include`` to the ``CPATH``
   environment variable (note: *not* ``PATH``). Create the variable if
   necessary.

6) The header files and the .dll for OpenCL that comes with the CUDA
   7.5 distribution also need to be installed into MingWpy.  Go to
   ``C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v7.5\include``
   and copy the ``CL`` directory into the MingWpy ``include`` directory.

   Next, go to ``C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\OpenCL`` and copy
   the ``OpenCL64.dll`` file into the MingWpy ``lib`` directory (it is
   next to ``include``).

   The CUDA distribution also comes with the static ``OpenCL.lib``, but
   trying to use that one instead of the ``OpenCL64.dll`` will cause
   programs compiled with ``futhark-opencl`` to crash, so ignore it
   completely.

Now you should be able to compile ``futhark-opencl`` and run Futhark
programs on the GPU.

Congratulations!

Setting up PyOpenCL
-------------------

The following instructions are for how to setup the
``futhark-pyopencl`` backend.

First install Mako using ``pip install mako``.

Also install PyPNG using ``pip install pypng`` (not stricly necessary,
but some examples make use of it).

7) Clone and fork the `PyOpenCL repository`_ to your hard drive. Do
   this instead of downloading the zip, as the zip will not contain
   some of the other repositories it links to and you will end up with
   missing header files.

8) If you have ignored the instructions and gotten Python 3.x instead
   2.7, you will have to do some extra work.

   Edit ``.\pyopencl\compyte\ndarray\gen_elemwise.py`` and
   ``.\pyopencl\compyte\ndarray\test_gpu_ndarray.py`` and convert most
   Python 2.x style print statements to Python 3 syntax. Basically wrap
   print arguments in brackets "(..)" and ignore any lines containing
   StringIO ``>>`` operator.

   Otherwise just go to the next point.

9) Go into the repo directory and from the command line execute
   ``python configure.py``.

   Edit ``siteconf.py`` to following::

     CL_TRACE = False
     CL_ENABLE_GL = False
     CL_INC_DIR = ['c:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v7.5\\include']
     CL_LIB_DIR = ['C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v7.5\\lib\\x64']
     CL_LIBNAME = ['OpenCL']
     CXXFLAGS = ['-std=c++0x']
     LDFLAGS = []

   Run the following commands::

     > python setup.py build_ext --compiler = mingw32
     > python setup.py install

If everything went in order, pyOpenCL should be installed on your machine now.

10) Lastly, Pygame needs to be installed.  Again, not stricly
    necessary, but some examples make use of it.  To do so on Windows,
    download ``pygame-1.9.2a0-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl`` from `here
    <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame>`_. ``cp27``
    means Python 2.7 and ``win_amd64`` means 64-bit Windows.

    Go to the directory you have downloaded the file and execute ``pip
    install pygame-1.9.2a0-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl`` from the command
    line.

Now you should be able to run the `Mandelbrot Explorer`_ and and `Game of Life`_ examples.

11) To run the makefiles, first setup ``make`` by going to the ``bin``
    directory of MingWpy and making a copy of
    ``mingw32-make.exe``. Then simply rename ``mingw32-make â€“
    Copy.exe`` or similar to ``make.exe``. Now you will be able to run
    the makefiles.
    
    Also, if you have not selected to add the optional Linux command line tools to ``PATH``
    during the ``Git for Windows`` installation, add the ``C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin``
    directory to ``PATH`` manually now.

12) This guide has been written off memory, so if you are having
    difficulties - ask on the `issues page`_. There might be errors in
    it.
